# Jumpkit - My personal jumpkit

This is my personal collection of config files and other stuff I need whenever I setup a new system.

It's mostly for my use, but feel free to use what you like.

## The Stuff

### Todo

+   todo.md

   A loosly organized set of things I might want to do when setting up a new system.

### Vim

+ .vimrc

   basic vim config

+ english.vim

   My silly and cheesy syntax highlighter just to give random text files a little color. They seem so sterile otherwise. 

   Usually goes in `~/.vim/syntax/english.vim`
